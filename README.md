# LArena
Game made for LD42 comp

Should be played 2-? players, ? since input manager takes 16 controllers, but have only tested with one and I know there's a limit of 4 on xbox 360 controls on a single computer.

If start the game solo you enter "practice mode" which is just the same as the real game but you can't win, and 1 death resets the game.

# Controls
* w/i/joystick_up and s/k/joystick_down to aim
* a/left/joystick_left and d/right/joystick_right to move
* q/u/gamepad_a/gamepad_x to join game in the beginning, and to jump while in game
* e/o/gamepad_b/gamepad_y to shoot, hold to charge.
* space/gamepad_start to start the game, start first after everone has joined the game

2 persons can play using the same controller.
